<, >, <= , >=, !== (strict not eq), === (strict eq), != (Not eq), == (eq).
- What data type do comparison expressions evaluate to?
True or false.
- What is the purpose of an `if` statement?
To execute a block of code if specified condition is true.
- Is `else` required in order to use an `if` statement?
If the first statment returns false then the else statment is there to run a true. It depends.
- Describe the syntax (structure) of an `if` statement.
The `if` keyword, condition in parentheses, code block wrapped in curly braces.

&& (and), || (or), ! (not).
- How do you compare two different expressions in the same condition?
With the Logical OR (||) operator, or the Logical AND (||) operator.
- What is the purpose of a `switch` statement?
To evaluate expressions, matching the same value as the result of the input expressions.

No but it is best practice to add a default because in case of no matching case clause the program would escape with the default.
