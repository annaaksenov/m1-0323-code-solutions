## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a **breakpoint** in responsive Web design?
It is a "point" at which a page's content & design will adapt to screen size or orientation for the best user experience.
- What is the advantage of using a percentage (_e.g._ `50%`) width instead of a fixed (_e.g._ `px`) width for a "column" class in a responsive layout?
Not all screens are the same width so using a percentage allows content to fit the format.
- If you introduce CSS rules for a smaller `min-width` _after_ the styles for a larger `min-width` in your style sheet, the CSS rules for the **smaller** `min-width` will "win". Why is that?
CSS Specificity. Newer rules will override previous rules.
